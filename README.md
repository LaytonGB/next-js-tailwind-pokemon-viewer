This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) created by Layton Burchell.

## Getting Started

This was submitted as part of an interview process. I've since used the project for developing my skills with NextJS. The submitted version has tag `v1.0.0`. 

To view the project, clone it locally with `git clone https://github.com/LaytonGB/next-js-tailwind-pokemon-viewer.git`.

If you wish to checkout the tagged version, do so by running `git checkout tags/v1.0.0`

Then, run one of the following:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
